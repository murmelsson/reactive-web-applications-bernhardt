# reactive-web-applications-bernhardt
Chapter7 is about how to deal with state in a reactive web app.

The tricky part was "non-Scala" i.e. DBA-uncomfort-zone for Mongo n Postgres on a local machine, but the Ch7-app itself is neat, not too simple but not too complex.

Methodology settled on: type the book code into a simple editor (gedit on ubuntu); sbt compile; refer to the book's source code when stuck (i.e. often). use IntelliJ occasionally as it makes flitting around the source code easier, and has ok debug process.
