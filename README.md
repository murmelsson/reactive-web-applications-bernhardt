# Code and any other notes for Ch11 Testing Reactive Apps

to push to clever cloud from a specific branch to a specific app using one repo:
for each app, give the upstream a name, e.g. "clever00"; "clever11".
...and for each branch being pushed, since you must push to upstream master, use e.g.:

```git push clever11 dCh11-test-reactive-aspects:master```
