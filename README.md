# reactive-web-applications-bernhardt

Reconstructed this repo to make Chapters folders in the master branch. Though ended up doing it in a kind of "recursive repo"-way, by umm, accident... changed that to get a more normal looking repo again with Chapter-snapshots.

The proper book-code is at: https://github.com/manuelbernhardt/reactive-web-applications
