Note that I local-machine copy-paste conf/application.conf excluding things like secret API keys, into a file called 
conf/application-dummy.conf, so that secret keys don't end up in a public repo.

So if you want to use this repo, you will need to rename the dummy.conf to the standard name, and add your own keys etc.
